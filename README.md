# react-d3-charts
A D3 charting library for React

* Line charts, Bar charts, Sparkline Charts, Donut Charts, Pie Charts, Node Charts, and Area Charts (more are coming soon)
* ES6 support
* Grid lines
* Legends
* Tooltips
* Tests!
* Demo app

## installation

```shell
$ npm install react-d3-charts
```

## usage

Check out the demo
```shell
$ npm run demo
$ open http://localhost:3000
```

There also tests that you should probably look at.

## code layout
The es6 source code is in the /src directory.

The published code is transpiled from /src to the /lib directory by running the build task (see below).

The build task is automatically called when the module is published (see package.json -> scripts -> prepublish).

The root index.js imports code from the /lib directory allowing end-users to seamlessly use the module without requiring babel or some other transpiler.

## tasks

run the tests
```shell
$ npm test
```

generate test coverage report
```shell
$ npm test --coverage
```

build the module for distribution
```shell
$ npm run build
```
